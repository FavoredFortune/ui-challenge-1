UI challenge 1 (CodeFellow 301 Lab)


## Overview

This is a time-limited test case to build a responsive site based on comps only, using HTML and CSS. 

## Requirements
Requirements

* Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site, of course, using semantic elements where possible.

* **Reminder:** Container elements (a box outside of your content box that might contain multiple content boxes) are very useful in managing layout. You will need to think about the relationship between parent and child / descendant elements as well as the order in which you place them in the HTML. 
* Be thoughtful about your CSS layout strategy.
* If you want, use SMACSS-style modularity to organize your CSS; there are no specific requirements. Feel free to try an alternate system for organizing your CSS.
* Style the page to reflect the comp images provided as closely as possible... the only text you should have in each box is the identifying letter, which should be centered horizontally and vertically. (The letter i should be included in the last box in the mobile view)
* For the desktop view, the content should be inside of a channel that is 960 pixels wide and is centered on wider screen sizes.
* You will probably find it helpful to give each of the boxes a different background color.
